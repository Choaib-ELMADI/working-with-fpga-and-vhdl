## TP 2 - Design of a 4-Bit Adder and Adder/Subtractor on FPGA

In this second session, we focused on:

- **Part a)** Designing a 4-bit adder on FPGA

  - Created and simulated a structural 4-bit adder with overflow (`ovf`) and carry-out (`cout`) detection.
  - Implemented the design on the DE1-SoC board using switches for inputs and LEDs for outputs.

- **Part b)** Designing a 4-bit adder/subtractor on FPGA

  - Developed and simulated a circuit for addition (`OP=0`) and subtraction (`OP=1`).
  - Implemented the design on the DE1-SoC board with mode selection using switches and results displayed on LEDs.
