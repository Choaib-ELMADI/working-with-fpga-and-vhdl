## TP 4 - Simple Processor Design and Implementation

In this session, we designed, simulated, and implemented a simple processor capable of performing basic operations like addition, subtraction, and data transfer between registers.

- **Part a)** Designing and simulating a simple processor

  - Created and simulated the processor using VHDL in Quartus, supporting instructions like `mv`, `mvi`, `add`, and `sub`.
  - Verified functionality through functional simulation.

- **Part b)** Implementing the processor on FPGA

  - Implemented the processor on the DE-1 SoC board, using switches for input, LEDs for output, and buttons for reset and clock control.
  - Tested functionality by executing instructions and observing behavior through LEDs.

This session provided hands-on experience in processor design, VHDL implementation, and FPGA-based testing.
