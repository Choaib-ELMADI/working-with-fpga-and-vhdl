# Working with FPGA and VHDL

This repository contains my hands-on work and practical sessions (TPs) with FPGA and VHDL. As part of my learning process, I am documenting each practical session, using the `ALTERA Cyclone V SoC DE-1 SoC` board.

These sessions include practical exercises and implementations for various tasks such as hardware design and VHDL coding for FPGA. The repository will be continuously updated as I progress with more sessions.
